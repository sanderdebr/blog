In this tutorial we will build a create, read, update and delete web application with React using React Hooks. Hooks let us use state and other features in functional components instead of writing class components.

This tutorial is divided up in the following sections:

<ol>
    <li>Setting up the project</li>
    <li>Adding users table</li>
    <li>Adding a user</li>
    <li>Deleting a user</li>
    <li>Updating a user</li>
    <li>Using the Effect Hook</li>
</ol>
